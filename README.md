## Self-Gardening-Sytem
- A project that automatically waters a plant based on its soil moisture level. 
- It also displays the temperature, humidity and sunlight the plant is recieving.
- I made this project long back for fun but thought it would be good idea to put it up on github.

# How it works
- The project works with an Arduino UNO, a microcontroller as brain and some C++ code(availabe at *main.py*). The project also uses a soil moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor and a photoresistor. 
- The projects uses the data from these sensors and turns a servo motor(you could easily alter the code to make it fit with anything else like a relay) to water the plant. It also displays some of the other data on a LCD screen.
- The data from the sensor is processed by the Arduino and the servos and lcd do the appropriate result.

# Instuctions
1. What you need
   1. An Arduino  
   2. A Soil moisture Sensor 
   3. A Humidity Sensor  ----
   4. A Temperature Sensor --I used a DH11 instead
   5. A Photoresistor
   6. A LCD screen
   7. Some resistors
2. Follow the circuit diagram (I have not added this yet but will do soon.)
3. Add the code to the arduino.<br>
*I will try to make better documentation soon*
